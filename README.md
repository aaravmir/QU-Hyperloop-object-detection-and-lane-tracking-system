# Software Backend

This project is a software application to detect objects on a race pod’s surroundings and output information to users digitally. While operating, the system collects information on key distances and the status of the track, and traces it with a machine-learning vision algorithm. The computer system provides the pod with vision of the track it is on and the objects surroundings it, and contains linked front-end software capable of displaying the information to users visually. The back-end software is engineered with a Python Framework using YOLO V3 and OpenCV for its object detection algorithm.

**Object Detection**

Uses YOLO V3 object detection algorithm to detect objects, highlighting and outputting it to the screen.
